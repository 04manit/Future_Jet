                    <h1>Drawbacks of AI in Education</h1>
                    <p>Here are few hitches that could affect the full development of machine intelligence in education :-</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It does not teach social skills and human connections; hence it cannot replace human teachers.<br>The tech requires internet connectivity always which comes with a cost and could be a problem in countries with no/slow connectivity.</li>
                        <li>AI comes with a huge cost implication; however, as the technology spreads the price would be forced down.</li>
                        <li>Intelligent machines could suffer error peculiar to computer systems, e.g. crashing, upgrade issues, virus attacks, etc.</li>
