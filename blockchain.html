                <p>Firstly, a user or a node will initiate a transaction signing it with its private key. Basically, the private key will generate a unique digital signature and make sure that no one can alter it. After that, the transaction will get broadcasted to the verifying nodes. Basically, here, the blockchain platform can use different methods to verify whether the transaction is valid or not. These methods or algorithms are called consensus algorithms.</p>
                <p>Once the nodes verify that the transaction is authentic, it will get a place in the ledger. Also, it will contain a timestamp and a unique ID to secure it further from any alteration. The block will then link up to the previous block, and then a new block will form a link with this block and so on. And this way, it creates a chain of blocks, thus the name blockchain.</p>

                        A public blockchain network is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks might include substantial computational power required, little or no privacy for transactions, and weak security. These are important considerations
                        for enterprise use cases of blockchain.

                    <p>
                        A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized peer-to-peer network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed to participate, execute a consensus protocol and maintain the shared
                        ledger. Depending on the use case, this can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on premises

                        Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be a permissioned. This places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network
                        and in certain transactions. Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.

                        Multiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These pre-selected organizations determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be
                        permissioned and have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.

                <h3>1. Better Transparency</h3>
                <p>
                    Transparency is one of the big issues in the current industry. To improve transparency, organizations have tried to implement more rules and regulations. But there is one thing that doesn’t make any system 100% transparency, i.e., centralization. With
                    blockchain, an organization can go for a complete decentralized network where there is no need for a centralized authority, improving the system’s transparency. A blockchain consists of peers who are responsible for carrying out transactions
                    and validating them. Not every peer takes part in the consensus method, but they are free to choose if they want to participate in the validation process. To provide validation through decentralization, the consensus method is used. Once
                    validated, each node keeps a copy of the transaction record. This way, the blockchain network handle transparency. Transparency has bigger implications when it comes to organizations. As mentioned earlier, governments can also utilize
                    transparency in building government processes or even conduct voting.

                <h3>2. Enhanced Security</h3>
                <p>
                    Blockchain technology utilizes advanced security compared to other platforms or record-keeping systems. Any transactions that are ever recorded needs to be agreed upon according to the consensus method. Also, each transaction is encrypted and has a proper
                    link to the old transaction using a hashing method. Security is also enhanced by the fact that each node holds a copy of the transactions ever performed on the network. So, if any malicious actor ever wanted to make changes in the transaction,
                    he won’t be able to do so as other nodes will reject his request to write transactions to the network. Blockchain networks are also immutable, which means the data, once written, cannot be reverted by any means. This is also the right
                    choice for systems that thrive on immutable data, such as systems that citizens age.

                <h3>3. Reduced Costs</h3>
                <p>
                    Right now, businesses spend a lot of money to improve to manage their current system. That’s why they want to reduce cost and divert the money into building something new or improving current processes. By using blockchain, organizations can bring down
                    a lot of costs associated with 3rd party vendors. As blockchain has no inherited centralized player, there is no need to pay for any vendor costs. On top of that, there is less interaction needed when it comes to validating a transaction,
                    further removing the need to spend money or time to do basic stuff.

                <h3>4. True Traceability</h3>
                <p>
                    With blockchain, companies can focus on creating a supply chain that works with both vendors and suppliers. In the traditional supply chain, it is hard to trace items that can lead to multiple problems, including theft, counterfeit, and loss of goods.
                    With blockchain, the supply chain becomes more transparent than ever. It enables every party to trace the goods and ensure that it is not being replaced or misused during the supply chain process. Organizations can also make the most out
                    of blockchain traceability by implementing it in-house.

                <p>
                    The last industrial benefit that blockchain brings is improved efficiency and speed. Blockchain solves the time-consuming process and automates them to maximize efficiency. It also eradicates human-based errors with the help of automation. The digital
                    ledger makes everything this possible by providing a single place to store transactions. The streamlining and automation of processes also mean that everything becomes highly efficient and fast. The fact that everything is stored in a
                    decentralized ledger also makes it easy for everyone to trust each other. In short, blockchain utilizes its unique way of data storage to provide a highly efficient process with trust, transparency, and immutability

                    <h3>1. Blockchain is not a Distributed Computing System</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain is a network that relies on nodes to function properly. The quality of the nodes determines the quality of the blockchain. It is not a distributed computing system where the network doesn’t depend on the involvement and participation of the
                        nodes. In comparison, a distributed computing system works to ensure that they verify the transactions according to the rules, ensure that they record the transactions, and also make sure that they have the transactional history for
                        each transaction. Each of these actions is similar to that of blockchain, but there is a lack of synergy, mutual assistance, and paralleling for each one of them.

                    <h3>2. Scalability is an Issue</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchains are not scalable as their counterpart centralized system. In simple words, the more people or nodes join the network, the chances of slowing down is more! With the right evolution of the technology, scalability options are being integrated
                        with the Blockchains. The solution is to do transactions off-blockchain and only use blockchain to store and access information. However, all these solutions are still not at par with the centralized systems. If you compare Bitcoin
                        and VISA transaction speed, you will find a huge difference between them. Right now, Bitcoin can only do 4.6 transactions per second. In comparison, VISA can do a whooping 1700 transactions per second.

                    <h3>3. Some Blockchain Solutions Consume Too Much Energy</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain technology came into light with Bitcoin. It uses the Proof-of-Work consensus algorithm that relied on the miners to do the hard work. The miners are incentivized to solve complex mathematical problems. The high energy consumption is what makes
                        these complex mathematical problems not so ideal for the real-world. Every time the ledger is updated with a new transaction, the miners need to solve the problems which means spending a lot of energy. However, not all blockchain solutions
                        work in the same manner. For example, permissioned or private networks do not have these problems as the number of nodes within the network is limited. Also, as there is no need for global consensus, they use efficient consensus methods
                        to reach consensus. But, if you take the most popular blockchain network, Bitcoin, the problem still persists that needs to be solved.

                    <h3>4. Cost And Implementation Struggle</h3>
                    <p>The underlying cost of implementing blockchain technology is huge. Even though most of the blockchain solutions including Hyperledger are open source, they require a lot of investment from the organization that is willing to pursue it.
                        There are costs associated with hiring developers, managing a team that excels at different aspects of blockchain technology, licensing costs if you opt for a paid blockchain solution, and so on. You also need to take care of the maintenance
                        cost associated with the solution. For enterprise blockchain projects, the cost can go over a million dollars as well. So for businesses who like the idea of blockchain, but do not have the funds or budget to carry out, might need
                        to wait more before they can jump into the blockchain bandwagon.

                    <h3>5. Not Completely Secure</h3>
                    <p>
                        Blockchain technology is more secure than other platforms. However, this doesn’t mean that it is completely secure. There are different ways the blockchain network can be compromised. Such as :-
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    51% attack: In the 51% attack, if an entity can control 51% or more of the network nodes, then it can result in control of the network. By doing so, they can modify the data in the ledger and also do double-spending. This is possible on networks where
                                    the control of miners or nodes are possible. This means that private networks are more likely to be safe from 51% attacks, whereas public ones are more vulnerable to this.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Double-spending: Double-spending is yet another problem with the current blockchain technology. To prevent double-spending the blockchain network deploys different consensus algorithms including Proof-of-Stake, Proof-of-Work, and so on. Double spending
                                    is only possible on networks with a vulnerability to the 51% attack.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    DDoS’s attack: In a DDoS attack, the nodes are bombarded with similar requests, congesting the network and bringing it down.
                                </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>
                                    Cryptographic cracking: Another way the blockchain technology is not secure is that the cryptographic solution that it utilizes. Quantum algorithms or computing are more than capable of breaking cryptographic cracking. However, blockchain solutions are
                                    now implementing quantum-proof cryptographic algorithms.
                                </p>

                    <h3>6. Expertise Knowledge</h3>
                    <p>
                        Implementing and managing a blockchain project is hard. It requires thorough knowledge from the business to go through the whole process. They need to hire multiple experts in the blockchain field that leads to the problem and hence it is counted as one
                        of the disadvantages of blockchain. Not only that they also need to train their existing professionals on how to utilize blockchain and then ensure that the management team can understand the complexities and outcomes of a blockchain-powered
                        business. This way, they can understand their requirements and help transform their business processes to utilize blockchain. Not to mention, if you find blockchain developers and specialists, they are harder to find and will cost
                        more compared to traditional developers due to their demand and supply ratio.

                                    With the help of Blockchain technology, basically, it is possible to impact a varied range of processes and techniques. It eliminates the need of trusted third party in the transactions. Corporate chances flourish for companies that can build applied
                                    Blockchain technologies aiming for particular transactions, like the mortgage industry. The existing mortgages needed a complicated web of title searches, title insurance, and uncountable minor transaction fees which are
                                    required to keep the system running. These systems occur because traditionally, the transfer of land has been a process which requires a significant amount of belief in the old records. The Blockchain technology was going
                                    to address all these concerns, and a particular property’s ledger consists of a verifiable and validated transactions history, lowering the necessity of institutions to provide risk modification and trust services.
