                    Nanotechnology is science, engineering, and technology conducted at the nanoscale, which is about 1 to 100 nanometres. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are the study and application of extremely small things and can be used across all the other science
                    fields, such as chemistry, biology, physics, materials science, and engineering.

                    The prefix ‘nano’ is referred to a Greek prefix meaning ‘dwarf’ or something very small and depicts one thousand millionth of a meter (10−9 m). At this size, materials begin to exhibit unique properties that affect physical, chemical, and biological behaviour.
                    Researching, developing, and utilizing these properties is at the heart of new technology. <br> <strong>To get an idea that how big is 1nanometre let us look at these examples</strong>

                <p>
                    The top-down approach is essentially the breaking down of bulk material to get nano-sized particles. This can be achieved by using advanced techniques such as precision engineering and lithography which have been developed and optimized by industry during
                    recent decades. Precision engineering supports the majority of the micro-electronics industry during the entire production process, and the high performance can be achieved through the use of a combination of improvements. These include
                    the use of advanced nanostructure based on diamond or cubic boron nitride and sensors for size control, combined with numerical control and advanced servo-drive technologies. Lithography involves the patterning of a surface through
                    exposure to light, ions or electrons, and the deposition of material on to that surface to produce the desired material

                <h3>Ascending (bottom-up)</h3>
                <p>
                    The bottom-up approach refers to the build-up of nanostructures from the bottom: atom-by-atom or molecule-by-molecule by physical and chemical methods which are in a nanoscale range (1 nm to 100 nm) using controlled manipulation of self-assembly of atoms
                    and molecules. Chemical synthesis is a method of producing rough materials which can be used either directly in product in their bulk disordered form, or as the building blocks of more advanced ordered materials. Self-assembly is a
                    bottom-up approach in which atoms or molecules organize themselves into ordered nanostructures by chemical-physical interactions between them. Positional assembly is the only technique in which single atoms, molecules or clusters can
                    be positioned freely one-by-one.

                <p>
                    Dry nanotechnology uses inorganic materials, including metals and semiconductors, to create items used by electrical and mechanical engineers to promote development in manufacturing techniques. it is used to manufacture structures in coal, silicon, inorganic
                    materials, metals and semiconductors that do not work with humidity.The active conduction electrons of these materials make them too reactive to operate in a 'wet' environment, but these same electrons provide the physical properties
                    that make 'dry' nanostructures promising as electronic, magnetic, and optical devices. Another objective is to develop 'dry' structures that possess some of the same attributes of the self-assembly that the wet ones exhibit.

                    Wet nanotechnology, studies nanoscale materials on a biological level, including cell parts. Wet nanotechnology (also known as wet nanotech) involves working up to large masses from small ones. Wet nanotechnology requires water in which the process occurs.
                    The process also involves chemists and biologists trying to reach larger scales by putting together individual molecules.The processes that will be used are going to take place in aqueous solutions and are very close to that of biotechnology

            <p>
                Nanotechnology is the understanding and control of matter at the nanometre scale, where unique phenomena enable novel applications. Encompassing nanoscale science, engineering, and technology, nanotechnology involves imaging, measuring, modelling, and
                manipulating matter at this length scale.

            </p>

            <p>
                Nanotechnologies involve the design, characterization, production, and application of nanoscale structures, devices, and systems that produces structures, devices, and systems with at least one novel/superior characteristic or property.

            </p>

            <p>
                At the core of nanotechnology is the fact that the properties of materials can be different at the nanoscale for two main reasons:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Nanomaterials have a relatively larger surface area when compared to the same mass of material produced in a larger form. This can make materials more chemically reactive (in some cases materials that are inert in their larger form are reactive when produced
                        in their nanoscale form), and affect their strength or electrical properties.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Quantum effects can begin to dominate the behaviour of matter at the nanoscale - particularly at the lower end – affecting the optical, electrical and magnetic behaviour of materials.

                            Nanotechnology can enable sensors to detect very small amounts of chemical vapors. Various types of detecting elements, such as carbon nanotubes, zinc oxide nanowires or palladium nanoparticles can be used in nanotechnology-based sensors. Because of the
                            small size of nanotubes, nanowires, or nanoparticles, a few gas molecules are sufficient to change the electrical properties of the sensing elements. This allows the detection of a very low concentration of chemical vapours.

                            A new semiconductor developed by Kyoto University makes it possible to manufacture solar panels that double the amount of sunlight converted into electricity. Nanotechnology also lowers costs, produces stronger and lighter wind turbines, improves fuel
                            efficiency and, thanks to the thermal insulation of some nanocomponents, can save energy.

                            Nanotechnology may hold the key to making space-flight more practical. Advancements in nanomaterials make lightweight spacecraft and a cable for the space elevator possible. By significantly reducing the amount of rocket fuel required, these advances
                            could lower the cost of reaching orbit and traveling in space.

            <div class="dsvntg_detail">
                <p>

                    1. Nanotechnology will make solar power more economical by reducing the cost of constructing solar panels and related equipment. Energy storage devices will become more efficient as a result. Nanotechnology will also open up new methods of generating
                    and storing energy.

                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="dsvntg_detail">
                <p>
                    2. Quantum dots are tiny light-producing cells that could be used for illumination or for purposes such as display screens. Silicon chips can already contain millions of components, but the technology is reaching its limit; at a certain point, circuits
                    become so small that if a molecule is out of place the circuit won't work properly. Nanotechnology will allow circuits to be constructed very accurately on an atomic level.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="dsvntg_detail">
                <p>
                    3. Nanobots could be sent into a patient's arteries to clear away blockages. Surgeries could become much faster and more accurate. Injuries could be repaired cell-by-cell. It may even become possible to heal genetic conditions by fixing the damaged genes.
                    Nanotechnology could also be used to refine drug production, tailoring drugs at a molecular level to make them more effective and reduce side effects.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="dsvntg_detail">
                <p>
                    4. Nanotechnology lets us make almost every manufactured product faster, lighter, stronger, smarter, safer and cleaner, and even more precise. For example, nanotubes and nanoparticles, which are tubes and particles only a few atoms across, and aerogels,
                    materials composed of very light and strong materials with remarkable insulating properties, could pave the way for new techniques and superior products.

                <p>
                    5. Nanotechnology can be advantageous when dealing with many diseases, including cancer. Cancer cells remain viable within a narrow temperature range. Using molecular recognition, nanoparticles could be created with cancer antibodies.

                    1) it has increased the pollution, which includes water pollution, air pollution. The pollution caused by nanotechnology is known as nano pollution. This kind of pollution is very dangerous for living organisms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="dsvntg_detail">
                <p>
                    2) it is thus essential to characterize the expected concentrations of engineered nanoparticles that may be present in the air, water and soil. Toxicological studies of fibrous and tubular nanostructures have shown that at extremely high doses of these
                    materials are associated with fibrotic lung responses and result in inflammation and an increased risk of carcinogenesis.

                    3) lack of employment in the fields of traditional farming and manufacturing and industrial sector because of the vast development in nanotechnology.
                </p>

            <div class="dsvntg_detail">
                <p>
                    4) It is possible that nanotechnology could be weaponized. Atomic weapons would be easier to create and novel weapons might also be developed. One possibility is the so-called "smart bullet," a computerized bullet that could be controlled and aimed very
                    accurately.

                    5) The potential for mass poisoning over a period of time. They may very well cause eventual health problems in the consumers that use them i.e. health effects could be at large scale. Inhaled nanoparticles may settle in the brain and lungs, which may
                    led to significant increases in biomarkers for inflammation and stress response.

                <p>
                    6) Nanotechnology is very expensive and developing it can cost a lot of money as to generate and assemble its particles in different forms needs many technologies.

                                Wearable fitness technology means we can monitor our health by strapping gadgets to ourselves. There are even prototype electronic tattoos that can sense our vital signs. But by scaling down this technology, we could go further by implanting or injecting
                                tiny sensors inside our bodies. This would capture much more detailed information with less hassle to the patient, enabling doctors to personalise their treatment. The possibilities are endless, ranging from monitoring
                                inflammation and post-surgery recovery to more exotic applications whereby electronic devices actually interfere with our body's signals for controlling organ function. Although these technologies might sound like a thing
                                of the far future, multi-billion healthcare firms such as GlaxoSmithKline are already working on ways to develop so-called "electroceuticals".

                                These sensors rely on newly-invented nanomaterials and manufacturing techniques to make them smaller, more complex and more energy efficient. For example, sensors with very fine features can now be printed in large quantities on flexible rolls of plastic
                                at low cost. This opens up the possibility of placing sensors at lots of points over critical infrastructure to constantly check that everything is running correctly. Bridges, aircraft and even nuclear power plants could
                                benefit.

                                If cracks do appear then nanotechnology could play a further role. Changing the structure of materials at the nanoscale can give them some amazing properties – by giving them a texture that repels water, for example. In the future, nanotechnology coatings
                                or additives will even have the potential to allow materials to "heal" when damaged or worn. For example, dispersing nanoparticles throughout a material means that they can migrate to fill in any cracks that appear. This
                                could produce self-healing materials for everything from aircraft cockpits to microelectronics, preventing small fractures from turning into large, more problematic cracks.

                                All these sensors will produce more information than we've ever had to deal with before – so we'll need the technology to process it and spot the patterns that will alert us to problems. The same will be true if we want to use the "big data" from traffic
                                sensors to help manage congestion and prevent accidents, or prevent crime by using statistics to more effectively allocate police resources.Here, nanotechnology is helping to create ultra-dense memory that will allow us
                                to store this wealth of data. But it's also providing the inspiration for ultra-efficient algorithms for processing, encrypting and communicating data without compromising its reliability.

                                The fight against climate change means we need new ways to generate and use electricity, and nanotechnology is already playing a role. It has helped create batteries that can store more energy for electric cars and has enabled solar panels to convert
                                more sunlight into electricity. The common trick in both applications is to use nanotexturing or nanomaterials (for example nanowires or carbon nanotubes) that turn a flat surface into a three-dimensional one with a much
                                greater surface area. This means that there is more space for the reactions that enable energy storage or generation to take place, so the devices operate more efficiently In the future, nanotechnology could also enable
                                objects to harvest energy from their environment. New nano-materials and concepts are currently being developed that show potential for producing energy from movement, light, variations in temperature, glucose and other
                                sources with high conversion efficiency.
