            <h1>AI is everywhere</h1>
            <p>Ever asked Alexa for the morning weather report, or passed through a public space that uses facial
                recognition technology, or paid for something using your credit card, or bought a product recommended to
                you by Amazon, or browsed potential love matches on a dating app? Of course, you have. Most of us have
                done one or all of these things, probably in the last week. Probably in the last 24 hours.<br><br>And,
                you guessed it, all of these everyday processes are underpinned by AI and data. AI allows your credit
                card company to determine – in the blink of an eye – that your latest transaction fits your spending
                pattern and isn’t fraudulent. Mastercard, for example, uses AI algorithms to assess the 75 billion
                transactions a year processed on its network. So, to put it bluntly, AI is already deeply embedded in
                your everyday life, and it’s not going anywhere.</p>

                    <p>Narrow AI is a type of AI which is able to perform a dedicated task with intelligence.The most common and currently available AI is Narrow AI in the world of Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>Narrow AI cannot perform beyond its field or limitations, as it is only trained for one specific task. Hence it is also termed as weak AI. Narrow AI can fail in unpredictable ways if it goes beyond its limits.<br><br>Apple Siriis a good example of Narrow AI, but it operates with a limited pre-defined range of functions.<br><br>IBM's Watson supercomputer also comes under Narrow AI, as it uses an Expert system approach combined with Machine learning and natural language processing.<br><br>Some Examples of Narrow AI are playing chess, purchasing suggestions on e-commerce site, self-driving cars, speech recognition, and image recognition.</p>

It is an outcome of general AI.<br><br>Some key characteristics of strong AI include capability include the ability to think, to reason,solve the puzzle, make judgments, plan, learn, and communicate by its own.<br><br>Super AI is still a hypothetical concept of Artificial Intelligence.

                    <h3>Reactive Machines</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Purely reactive machines are the most basic types of Artificial Intelligence.<br><br>Such AI systems do not store memories or past experiences for future actions.<br><br>These machines only focus on current scenarios and react on it as per possible best action.<br><br>IBM's Deep Blue system is an example of reactive machines.<br><br>Google's AlphaGo is also an example of reactive machines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Limited Memory</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Limited memory machines can store past experiences or some data for a short period of time.<br><br>These machines can use stored data for a limited time period only.<br><br>Self-driving cars are one of the best examples of Limited Memory systems. These cars can store recent speed of nearby cars, the distance of other cars, speed limit, and other information to navigate the road.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Theory of Mind</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Theory of Mind AI should understand the human emotions, people, beliefs, and be able to interact socially like humans.<br><br>This type of AI machines are still not developed, but researchers are making lots of efforts and improvement for developing such AI machines.</p>
                    </div>

                    <h3>Self-Awareness</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Self-awareness AI is the future of Artificial Intelligence. These machines will be super intelligent, and will have their own consciousness, sentiments, and self-awareness.<br><br>These machines will be smarter than human mind.<br><br>Self-Awareness AI does not exist in reality still and it is a hypothetical concept.</p>

            Following are the main goals of Artificial Intelligence:
            <ol>
                <li>Replicate human intelligence</li>
                <li>Solve Knowledge-intensive tasks</li>
                <li>An intelligent connection of perception and action</li>
                <li>
                    Building a machine which can perform tasks that requires human intelligence such as:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Proving a theorem</li>
                        <li>Playing chess</li>
                        <li>Plan some surgical operation</li>
                        <li>Driving a car in traffic</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Creating some system which can exhibit intelligent behavior, learn new things by itself,
                    demonstrate, explain, and can advise to its user.</li>

                <div id="accordion-3">
                    <h3>High Accuracy with less errors</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>AI machines or systems are prone to less errors and high accuracy as it takes decisions as per pre-experience or information.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div>
                        <p>The hardware and software requirement of AI is very costly as it requires lots of maintenance to meet current world requirements.</p>

                    <h3>Can't think out of the box</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>Even we are making smarter machines with AI, but still they cannot work out of the box, as the robot will only do that work for which they are trained, or programmed.</p>

                    <h3>No feelings and emotions</h3>
                    <div>
                        <p>AI machines can be an outstanding performer, but still it does not have the feeling so it cannot make any kind of emotional attachment with human, and may sometime be harmful for users if the proper care is not taken.</p>
